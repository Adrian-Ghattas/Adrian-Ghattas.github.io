      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student in the Software Engineering program. I enjoy coding and solving problems, and in my free time, I like to play sports to stay active and energized. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills every day.

        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>
          I have some beginner experience with design through a few projects completed during my early university classes. One of these projects was <strong>Quiz-Wiz</strong>, a web application that used AI technology to generate quiz questions based on a given subject. While this app is no longer active, it helped me gain practical insight into basic UI design and user interaction concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am actively developing my design skills by taking a UI design course, where I am learning key principles such as user-centered design, visual communication, and prototyping. I enjoy combining my software engineering background with design thinking to create functional and appealing interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue to grow, I look forward to applying more advanced techniques like heuristic evaluation and usability testing in my workflow.
