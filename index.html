        <h2>How I Work?</h2>
        <p>
          I have a bit of design experience from a few university projects. One of the more memorable ones was <strong>Quiz-Wiz</strong>, a web app I worked on with a team of five. The idea was to use AI to generate quiz questions based on a topic the user picks. It was a fun concept, but we couldnâ€™t fully get the AI part working the way we wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mainly worked on the design and layout, trying to make the interface clean and easy to use. Even though it was a beginner-level project, it taught me a lot about building something with the user in mind and working with a team to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, Iâ€™ve been learning more about what makes a good user experience and trying to improve my design approach every time I start something new.
